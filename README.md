# Public_Dataset
Here we will store information on the public Datasets for Consumption and Production. 

Uppsala - Energiportal
This website has both, real time (API key necesarry?) abd historical data from public PVs in Uppsala. Information on the houses etc. are here: https://energiportalregionuppsala.se/about. In total they promote 24 PV-Panels there. Furthermore they have historical datasets publicly available: https://energiportalregionuppsala.se/open-data. 

They have either: separated information on each house / facility from 2019 - 2021, or combined information. Sadly they only provide the production side and NOT the consumption side.
